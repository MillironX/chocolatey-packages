    <summary>The World’s Foremost Open-Source Grand Strategy Game</summary>
    <description>TripleA is a turn based strategy game and board game engine, similar to Axis &amp; Allies or Risk. Though TripleA comes with many games inside, it is just an engine for playing games, and is not a game itself.  TripleA started out as a World War II simulation, but has since expanded to include different conflicts, as well as variations and mods of popular games and maps (a ‘map’ is like a board, while a ‘game’ is a specific setup on a map/board).</description>
